We introduce FourierKAN (FR-KAN), a variant of the promising MLP alternative called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), as classification heads for transformer-based encoders. Our studies reveal an average increase of 10% in accuracy and 11% in F1-score when incorporating FR-KAN heads instead of traditional MLP heads for several transformer-based pre-trained models across multiple text classification tasks. FR-KAN heads also train faster and require fewer parameters. 

## Methodology Overview

We propose feature-based fine-tuning of the FR-KAN classification head with different transformer-based pre-trained language models. 

## Performance Evaluation

We evaluated the performance of seven models on seven text classification datasets based on accuracy and F1 score.

## Notebooks
- The experiments on every model and dataset can be conducted following the notebooks in `notebooks_experiments`. 
- To conduct ablations on the parameter count of the best-performing models and the impact of grid size, follow the notebooks in `notebooks_ablation`.
- For overall result generation, follow `results.ipynb`.
- To reproduce the visualizations in our work, follow `visualization.ipynb`.
